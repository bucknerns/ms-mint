The tool extracts data within specified windows of retention time and m/z-values using a pre-defined list of peaks that can be changed from project to project. Therefore, the tool allows to reproduciblibly extract data from large numbers of MS files. The app's frontend is build using Plotly-Dash and runs locally in a browser. Thought, the Python functions provided can be imported and used in any python project. Installation Here we use conda from the miniconda (or alternatively anaconda ) package to install dependencies in a virtual environment. git clone https://github.com/soerendip/ms-mint cd ms-mint conda create -n ms-mint -c plotly lxml matplotlib pandas pandoc pip plotly plotly_express dash dash-bootstrap-components pyqt python=3 scipy setuptools sqlite statsmodels flask conda activate ms-mint pip install pyteomics openpyxl colorlover python setup.py install # Don't use pip to install it.
