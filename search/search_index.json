Its main function is to sum up intensity values from usually pre-defined windows in m/z and scan-time (also called retention time) space. These windows can be provided in a csv-file or set programmatically. Therefore, a large number of MS-files can be processed in very standardized and reproducible manner. The tool can be used with a browser based graphical user interface (GUI) implemented as interactive dashboard with Plotly-Dash . A second (experimental) GUI is available that runs integrated in a Jupyter Notebook . Alternatively, the ms_mint package can be imported as python library to be integrated in any Python script and processing pipeline to automate MS-file processing. Installation With Anaconda (Miniconda) conda create -n ms-mint python=3.8 conda activate ms-mint pip install ms-mint The server to run the GUI can be started with Mint.py Then navigate to http://localhost:9999. With PIP The program can be installed in a Python 3 (>= 3.7) environment using pip : pip install ms-mint The server to run the GUI can be started with Mint.py Then navigate to http://localhost:9999. From source Here we use conda from the miniconda (or alternatively anaconda ) package to install dependencies in a virtual environment. git clone https://github.com/soerendip/ms-mint cd ms-mint conda create -n ms-mint python=3.8 conda activate ms-mint pip setup.py install # for regular install pip install -e . # for development Start the application Start the app with conda activate ms-mint # if you run MINT in an Anaconda environment Mint.py Then navigate to the following ULR with your browser: http://localhost:9999/ The GUI The graphical user interface is explained in more detail here","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"MINT (Metabolomics Integrator) is an app for processing mzML and mzXML mass-spectrometry (MS) files in MS1 mode.

Thought, the Python functions provided can be imported and used in any Python project independently. Select MS Files (mzXML or mzML) Individual files can be added to an in worklist using the ADD FILE(S) button. If the checkbox Add files from directory is checked, all files from a directory and its subdirectories are imported that end on mzXML or mzML (not yet supported). The box is checked by default. Note that files are always added to the worklist. The worklist can be cleared with the CLEAR FILES button, which has no effect on the selected peaklists. Select Peaklist A standard peaklist is provided. A user defined peaklist can be selected and used with the SELECT PEAKLIST FILE(S) button. Peaklists are explained in more detail here . Run MINT The number of cores used for MINT can be selected with the Select number of cores slider. The maximum number shown here depends on the computer on which MINT is running.

It is provided as csv file and essentially contains the definitions of peaks to be extracted. A single peak is defined by five properties that need to be present as headers in the csv file which will be explained in the following: peak_label : A unique identifier such as the biomarker name or ID. Even if multiple peaklist files are used, the label have to be unique across all the files. mz_mean The target mass (m/z-value) in [Da]. mz_width The width of the peak in the m/z-dimension in units of ppm. The window will be mz_mean +/- ( mz_width mz_mean 1e-6 ). Usually, a values between 5 and 10 are used. rt_min The start of the retention time for each peak in [min]. rt_max The end of the retention time for each peak in [min]. intensity_threshold A threshold that is applied to filter noise for each window individually. Can be set to 0 or any positive value.
