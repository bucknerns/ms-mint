The tool extracts data within specified windows of retention time and m/z-values using a pre-defined list of peaks that can be changed from project to project. Therefore, the tool allows to reproduciblibly extract data from large numbers of MS files. The app's frontend is build using Plotly-Dash and runs locally in a browser. Thought, the Python functions provided can be imported and used in any python project. Installation Here we use conda from the miniconda (or alternatively anaconda ) package to install dependencies in a virtual environment. git clone https://github.com/soerendip/ms-mint cd ms-mint conda create -n ms-mint -c plotly lxml matplotlib pandas pandoc pip plotly plotly_express dash dash-bootstrap-components pyqt python=3 scipy setuptools sqlite statsmodels flask conda activate ms-mint pip install pyteomics openpyxl colorlover python setup.py install # Don't use pip to install it.

If the checkbox Add files from directory is checked, all files from a directory and its subdirectories are imported that end on mzXML or mzML (not yet supported). The box is checked by default. Note that files are always added to the worklist. The worklist can be cleared with the CLEAR FILES button, which has no effect on the selected peaklists. A standard peaklist is provided. A user defined peaklist can be selected and used with the SELECT PEAKLIST FILE(S) button. Peaklists A peaklists contains the definitions of peaks that are extracted. A peak is defined by five properties: peakLabel peakMz : The target mass (m/z-value) peakMzWidth[ppm] : The width of the peak in the m/z-dimension in units of ppm (peakMz/1e6) rtmin : The start retention time for each peak. rtmax : The final retention time for each peak. peakLabel A unique identifier such as the biomarker name or ID","title":"Welcome to MINT (Metabolomics Integrator)"},{"location":"#welcome-to-mint-metabolomics-integrator","text":"MINT is an app for summing up intensity values from consistent mass spectrometry (MS) files in mzML and mzXML format.
